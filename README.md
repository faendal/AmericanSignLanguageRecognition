# American Sign Language Recognition with YOLO v11

This project aims to implement a YOLOv11 based-model for recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) gestures.

The model is trained on a dataset of ASL letter signs and can be used for real-time sign language recognition.

The dataset can be found at [`American Sign Language Letters`](https://universe.roboflow.com/duyguj/american-sign-language-letters-vouo0/dataset/1)
